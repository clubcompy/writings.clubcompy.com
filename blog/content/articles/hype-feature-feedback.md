## Sales for Developers

It sometimes seems like being a software developer makes one naturally opposed
to doing sales work.  We am certainly in that boat, and we needed to
define some sort of product development cycle that _includes_ coding, but isn't
dominated by it.  We needed to force ourselves to do something more like 
two-thirds Sales and one-thirds Coding if ClubCompy was to take off.

And so, here are the phases of each cycle we will use to develop and hype 
[clubcompy.com](https://clubcompy.com):     

### Hype

In the Hype Phase, our goal is to complete tasks dedicated to courting and
keeping customers.  We will host events, create marketing content, or speak 
out about the product's latest features.

Initially, in each Hype Phase we plan to produce a YouTube video aimed
at kids and young adults who are interested in coding.  These videos will be
part ClubCompy tutorial and part entertainment.  As funding allows, our goal
would be to release these videos on a regular cadence, up to once per week.

The impacts of each Hype Phase should be measurable, like positive press, 
tweets, and new subscriber counts.  

Cheers,<br />
Woldie
