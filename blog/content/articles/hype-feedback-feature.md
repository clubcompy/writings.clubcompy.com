Something about being a software developer tends to make one naturally opposed
to doing sales and marketing.  I am certainly in that boat; I really like 
coding and that's about it.  My brand of creativity is tends to gravitate to a 
problem solving space - more rubiks cube and less artistry.  But, I acted in 
high school and college, too.  I can put on a show if I prepare and practice
enough.

The attraction of code is so strong, and there is so much left to do.  To simply
block off hours on my calendar here and there and force myself to do the 
non-coding stuff was not going to work.  I needed to force myself to close my 
IDE for an extended period of time to do the reading, writing, planning, and 
video production that ClubCompy requires and not start the IDE until that work 
is finished.  I needed a product development cycle that _included_ coding, but 
was not _dominated_ by it.  

My time will need to be divided something like two-thirds business and 
one-thirds coding.  So, out of necessity, I devised **Hype, Feedback, Feature** 
to focus and direct my productivity cycles for starting up

### Hype

In the Hype Phase, our goal is to complete time-boxed tasks dedicated to
courting and keeping customers.  We will host events, create marketing content,
or speak out about the product's latest features.  We will rank our planned
tasks both by anticipated ROI and by estimated time-to-complete.

The impacts of each Hype Phase should be measurable, like new subscriber counts,
positive mentions in publications, and tweets.  

Initially, in each Hype Phase we plan to produce a YouTube video aimed
at kids and young adults who are interested in coding.  These videos will be
part ClubCompy tutorial and part entertainment.  As funding allows, our goal
would be to release these videos on a regular cadence, up to once per week.
