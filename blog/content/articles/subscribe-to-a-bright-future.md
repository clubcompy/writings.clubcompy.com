I have always encouraged my programmer friends to adopt a side/hobby project to
get tech experience outside the particular technical niche they live in at their
day job.  Usually these side projects get hosted on Github, which also provides
legit resum√© padding.

Skills are great, and I've learned a ton, but my dream has always been to turn 
these hobby/passion home projects into real businesses.  Well, one of those
dreams is finally coming true:  [ClubCompy](https://clubcompy.com) has been my
passion project for years, and I have decided it is ready to be commercialized,
starting with this post.

_\[NOTE:  We do not talk much about ClubCompy's features in this post.  We will
save that for future articles.  For this inaugural blog post we thought it 
would be illuminating to sketch out our approach to growing the business and
give ourselves a touchstone for the future. - ed.\]_

## Bootstrapping an Ethical Tech Startup

In order to build ClubCompy right and for our brand to be successful, I
realized that we needed to establish a powerful company ethos that will protect
and buoy us as we grow.

We tie three disparate beliefs together here that will guide how our company 
makes decisions:

* **Digital Panopticon** &mdash; most companies and governments 
that can spy on their customers for profit and control do so, often in the most
underhanded ways.  And, given that the public is increasingly aware of and 
disturbed by these infractions, there should be huge growth potential with those
folks for any tech company that avoids collecting Personal Information.  We want
to build a tech company known for respecting its users' privacy.

* **Software is Broken** &mdash; the best software is invisible, working 
properly and solving problems dependably in the background.  Companies regularly
die because some software they created goes out of control and begins failing in 
loud and shocking ways.  So we theorize that companies with excellent software
quality should be healthier and could/should live longer.  We want the company 
to live a long, bug-free life.

* **Funding Models** &mdash; juiced by the **Digital Panopticon**, amoral tech 
firms are addicted to bundling and auctioning your sweet, sweet Personal 
Information for cash.  Hindsight being 20/20, that reads as a lazy,
soul-crushing, dead-end way to get paid.  You know what?  We'll take a hard pass
on the soul-crushing!<br/>
<br/>Instead, digital subscriptions strike us as the most honest and ethical
funding model for any tech business that wants to continually grow.  
Subscriptions provide steady funding, which makes business planning less 
stressful and less cutthroat.  And subscriptions allow the customer to vote on 
the product with their wallets, with the freedom to start and stop their
subscriptions at any time.

### Digital Panopticon

We believe eventually the public will revolt against corporations and
governments that hoard our data.  The aphorism that "data is the new gold" will
someday transmogrify into "Personal Information is the new plutonium".  We will
be prepared for this cultural shift and have a clear conscious when it comes.
It is our mission to collect as little of your data as possible and still be
able to host web applications.  Like golf, we'll always be playing for the 
lowest score.

Having ClubCompy target children as our primary user segment demands that we 
provide the highest protections for their information and their safety.  We will
never monetize yours or your childrens' personal information, habits, or actions
taken on our website.  And, we will constantly make tough design decisions that
favor your privacy and internet safety over shiny features.

### Software is Broken

It is obvious that **Software is Broken**.  The biggest companies with the
greatest technical talent clearly cannot maintain their software over time.
This is partly due to "feature-itis" where a VP or project manager's climb in
these organizations is tied to flashy, ephemeral pet projects or dubious 
features not requested by users.

Perhaps the original vision of the software was pure.  But over time, an 
unceasing train of "feature-itis" insults will erode the software's 
foundations.  For many reasons, bugs always creep in that become too costly to
fix.  Total rewrites become a necessity, which are the riskiest of software
projects (~80% failure rate!)  Weakness induced by software rot makes a company
vulnerable to competitors who do not (yet) suffer from the same degradation.

We can counter this rot somewhat because we have discovered how to create
virtually bug-free computer code.  (Not a shocker, this takes tons of care and 
painstaking effort.)  That said, bugs in software extend beyond computer code 
stemming from bad requirements, design and architecture.  These crisscross 
non-technical social and business concerns.  Non-code bugs are an unsolved
problem that are exacerbated by the corporate-climbing project manager dilemma.

Our working theory on how to address this is that senior leadership needs to A) 
be technical, and B) have the courage to act as a countervailing wind, pushing
back against bug accretion.  

If a component is currently buggy, feature development must be paused until the
bugs are eliminated to everyone's satisfaction.  We must always be nitpicky
about bugs, even the small ones, and the top brass must give license and
encouragement to teams to keep our pets' cages clean.

Even given all those unknowns, we still view "feature-itis" as the chief
destroyer of software.  Now, what if we could pull the dollars out of
feature development as soon as we finish implementing the software's original
vision?  Call the software '**done**' and then move on to something else.  Then 
"feature-itis" would struggle to sink its teeth in.  

As obvious as that plan sounds, getting to '**done**' almost never happens in
the software biz for a bevy of reasons.  For us, calling '**done**' will
actually play a major part in our success story, especially as it dovetails
with our approach to **Funding Models**.   

### Funding Models

The monthly subscription is the main vehicle we have chosen to steer clear of
the sibling terrors, **Software is Broken** and **Digital Panopticon**.

[ClubCompy](https://clubcompy.com) is our first product offering, and we intend
to work on it for 4-6 years.  We will pay for hosting and development using your
subscriptions.  After we will implement our vision, and get it completely
bug free, we will call it '**done**'.  ClubCompy will then transition to 
maintenance mode and, should everything go to plan, CC will require only a 
fraction of its engineering resources for upkeep and ongoing operation.

By calling a product of ours '**done**', we can do something amazing:  plow the 
monthly subscription dollars allocated to engineering into the development of 
an _entirely new_ software product.  And when that product is released, our 
subscribers will have access to both products with no bump in subscription fees.
And then we can work on a third product, and so on ...  

How big of a value snowball we can build with your subscription dollars over
time?  Can we get big enough to have multiple teams building products
for you simultaneously?  Will we take requests?  Just how big can a company get
with such a model?

Also, no matter how good our software quality is, all software has a finite 
lifespan because technology moves on and people move on.  How should we handle
the inevitable "end of life" of something like a ClubCompy?  We still have
so many questions.

We are certain that, if we ever allow **Software is Broken** to rule in our 
dojo, then our subscribers will rightly abandon us.  In desperation, we might
even sacrifice our principles to join the **Digital Panopticon** and mine our
remaining users' data for digital gold.  This is a deal-with-the-devil scenario
we would rather not consider.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the status quo of **Software is Broken** would make us chase the
quick cash of the **Digital Panopticon**.  We choose instead the honest 
**Funding Models** of monthly subscriptions, sales of physical and virtual merch
and maybe a bit of custom-made hardware along with our bug-free coding standards 
that will carry our products safely to '**done**'.  Our approach _feels_ like
it will give us a competitive advantage, but we'll have to test it out to be
certain. 

Thank you for reading!  Get ready to flip some tables in the software industry.

In our next post we will discuss _Hype, Feature, Feedback ~ Planning Our Cycles
of Startup Success_.  Don't you dare miss it!

Love,<br/>

P.S.  Once ClubCompy is '**done**', what will our next product be?  That's a
secret, you'll just have to wait and see.  üòè  We will say that it will not be
EdTech like ClubCompy and be much more ambitious.  It will live in another
market segment altogether (don't pigeonhole us), one that everyone can benefit
from.
