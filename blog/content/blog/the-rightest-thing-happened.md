Once in awhile, right things happen.  Not just that, but rightest things happen
from the very get go.  Why is this?  It can't always be dumb luck, sometimes
there have to be **reasons**.

Lego System blocks from the 50's can interlock with blocks made today.  This is
magic to me that the system was great from very beginning.  Manufacturing and
plastic technology have only improved to where Lego can now produce intriciate
decorations and figures that plugin to the Lego system - but the original brick
concept and the form factor and the shape of the studs, etc were awesome and
interoperate today.

When planning the ClubCompy Flier, I am similarly mystified by the
Computer magazines of the late 70's and early 80's.  Those magazines had code
in them, and not just a little bit of code as a curiousity.  We saw page after
page of code.  Sometimes the program listings were in a high level language like
BASIC and in later years in _machine code_:  pages and pages of indecipherable
hexidecimal numbers!  In what multiverse would something like raw computer code
appear in a magazine on a rack at the supermarket?

I could understand seeing such a rarity at a bookstore or magazine store,
maybe that makes sense since their catalogs are huge.  Yet, in the early
80's, for a few years, coding magazines was supermarket fare!  This seems as
unlikely a scenario to me as seeing the _Sanskrit Quarterly_ or _Underwater
Basket Weaver Times_ on the rack; code wasn't a mass-market thing in the 1980's.

Part of my fascination lies with my intuition that the invisible hand couldn't
have seeded the ground for my generation of coders more subtly and perfectly
than with these magazines.  I am struggling to understand how they knew and how
the entire code-in-a-magazine form factor with many publishers involved came
into being.  I am immensely grateful to the authors and editors and publishers
of these magazines as they set me on my career path.  One of my future goals is
to interview publishers of that era first to thank them and then to understand
what their situations were back then.

One credible theory of why these magazines existed was: computers were a fad,
you could buy them for a song starting around 1983, and store managers just
bought whatever their buyers told them to buy in order to stock their shelves.
Fads do drive irrational, exuberant behavior.  Ugh, I guess that could explain
the demand, but what about the supply?

From the investors, publishing houses, editors, layout folks and amateur
programmers who submitted the article content on down - there's this whole
ecosystem and a _refined culture_ that existed that needs explanation.  It
clearly wasn't niche; looking at all the publishers worldwide, there was a
small industry devoted to computer coding magazines.

My experience: me, little guy, 1983.  Electrical Engineer father buys the
family a used Commodore Vic-20 and hooks it to the family room TV.  Its huge
blocky font is reminiscent of what we saw on the Atari 2600, but a lot smaller
on-screen so its absolutely high tech.  It had no documentation, but came with
3 massive cartridges that offered games, which were really fun.  But turn it
on without a cartridge, and a tantalizing alien world beckoned - a flashing
cursor ready to accept my commands.  I typed random stuff, but it would just
complain.  What did "syntax error" mean?

My parents could not answer my "what now?" questions but learned from people at
work that magazines existed containing programs I could type-in.  Mother carts
me to Zody's and pulls one of the relevant magazines off the rack.  Look at how
charming this thing is!

I tear into the thing and there's two handy pages at the back that give an
introduction to programming, what code was (monospaced fonts), and how to enter
and run my programs.  Two pages!

[How to type in programs pages]

I set about typing in the shortest program I could find.  It was very painful.
Plopped down on the carpet, and too close to the TV, I had to hunt and
peck on the keyboard for every symbol in the magazine.  My family was very
gracious in giving up the TV that night for my experiments.  Unfortunately, I
had picked the first short listing I could see, a snippet from the adjacent Bug
Swatter column that offered a bug fix for a previous month's article that was
only a fragment of a larger program.  When I finally finished typing and
attempted to launch my masterpiece with the `RUN` command, it failed
immediately.  Very disappointing!  The game I was promised sounded very fun.

There I was, entering codes right away.  Without any help from parents, I
figured it all out.  Like, it was horrifying to discover that just flicking the
power button on the Vic would lose all my work.  But then the magazine told me
about "saving".  The computer came with a tape player called the Datasette, and
I understood I could save my work with it, rewind the tape and "load" the code
back into the computer!  There was a dedicated port on the back of the machine
where the wire plugged in.

Looking back, I can see it was all such a tenuous, fragile setup that could
have failed in 1000 ways.  And yet that meager kit was plenty to get me started
on my computing journey.

My family never had the money for a proper setup.  So, we would pick up
odds and ends at a steep discount for cash from church friends or at closeout
sales.  By the 90's, I had a complete rig:  two disk drives, a Commodore 128,
monitor, tons of games (erm, some borrowed from friends) with accessories, a
printer with a big box of continuous paper that would feed in from the back of
my little desk, and a full GUI operating system running GEOS that had a WYSIWYG
word processor called geoWrite that I used to type school reports.  It was my
sprawling, glorious little computer empire.  Every component had quirks and
secret tricks that I knew about and had mastered.

Programming with computers was so accessible and egalitarian in the 1980's
because novices and professionals all had access to the same tools and
information.  We were all at the ground level given there was no mature
consumer software industry.

The apex of my Commodore programming experience probably came from my Babbage's
clearance item purchase of geoProgrammer in the early 90's.  geoProgrammer is
a tool suite that I still think about.  It was a system for GEOS that let you
write programs in 6510 assembly and compile and link them into custom GEOS apps.
geoWrite was used as the code editor, which is cool to me because the code
could be styled like any other word processor document.  It's a strange coding
superpower of the GEOS software ecosystem that we find lacking even now.
