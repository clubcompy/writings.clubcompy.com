We have also considered running a Discord server to help us better connect with
our patreons.  It will be instrumental during the Reflect phase to have extended 
conversations with the community about proposed features for the next cycle, and
we have seen examples of vibrant Discord communities where those kinds of 
constructive discussions with users do happen.

Such Discord communities appear to succeed by having committed moderator
volunteer/employee/wingman the manage the channels and speak on behalf of the 
community when unproductive discussions need to be quashed.  We do not yet have
anyone that could fill that role.  Also, Discord is no place for kids, so we
would need to figure out how to rig an invite-only thing where we could restrict
access to our adult subscriber users.

While Discord is intriguing to us, we will have to wait on it until the 
community is more established and we can manage it properly.
