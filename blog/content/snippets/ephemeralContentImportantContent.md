One complaint we have about YouTube is that its searchable long tail of content
stretches all the way back to its founding.  This mind-boggling capability of YT
to recall all content ever published drives the value of a creator's new
content creations down to almost nothing.  One's new content must compete with
endless past works that range in quality from priceless to trash.

The long tail and just plain abundance of channels on YouTube is a distraction
inviting mindless content binging.  The long tail particularly disserves kid
audiences who have not yet developed the skill of picking up cues for what
makes content worth their time like production values or story.

Services like Twitch are designed to be more "in the moment" with past video
clips automatically falling off the end of a channel's clip browser into the
void after a set time.  This is a feature we would like to emulate on ClubCompy.
When we can achieve a regular cadence to our video production, it would
probably make sense to make our videos fall off the YouTube channel seasonally.

YouTube is tough to beat as a content delivery service, and we would like to
use it to distribute our shows.  One thought we have to partly divorce
ourselves from the long tail is to implement our own show browser on
[clubcompy.com](https://clubcompy.com) and embed the YT player on each of our
videos' pages there.

We can configure the player to our needs by embedding the YT player on our own
website rather than directing our customers to YouTube's website.  For
example, we can configure the embedded player to restrict suggested videos
shown after our videos end to only our channel's videos.  This should help to
lessen the general distraction-factor of YouTube.  And, hosting our own browse
function will facilitate switching to another video service if YouTube ever
decides to censor us for any reason.
