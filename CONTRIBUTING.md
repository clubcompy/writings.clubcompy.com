# Contributing to ClubCompy.com content

There are many ways you can contribute to ClubCompy.com's development and
success.  

First and foremost, please become a Patreon subscriber to the site.
With your monthly subscription, your family gains access to the _KidCompy
Virtual Computing Environmentâ„¢_ (VCE).  Success of this project depends on
your direct financial support.  Please help us by funding ClubCompy's 
development!

Next, the success of this project will partly lie in the quality and
accessibility of the information that surrounds it.  A critical part of that is
our documentation site for the Comfy Computer Language (see the 
<code>comfylang</code> subfolder) that runs within the VCE.  To document a 
computer language in classical style is a massive effort and we could use your
help with technical content creation and editing that is accessible to 
elementary school kids.  Please use the GitHub Issues and Pull Requests and 
make your mark on this most important endeavor.  (Please see the _Code of 
Conduct for Contributors_ section below for details.)  THANK YOU!  

_/TODO: we have a statement of intent about content contributed to the 
comfylang site to write up in the blog and link to here/_ 

Finally, we will be following our
[Hype, Reflect, Iterate](https://clubcompy.com/blog/hype-reflect-iterate/)
methodology to make our development of ClubCompy.com incremental.  Please
give ClubCompy a boost!  You could:  

* Watch and discuss our videos or documentation with your kids to further their
knowledge and understanding, 
* Share links on social media with your community, 
* Make a critique video on YouTube, or 
* Stream live coding on the VCE and show off your coding skills

Any energy you can lend to our development cycles makes our chances of success
that much greater.
 
## Code of Conduct for Contributors

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you
wish to make via a GitHub issue with the owners of this repository before
making a change.  Woldrich, Inc. is not obligated to act on ideas or
requests made via GitHub issues. 

This project's owners cannot merge your Pull Request unless all contributors to
the Pull Request assign their copyrights to content they have contributed.  
Woldrich, Inc. reserves all rights to use, edit, or delete all content 
contributed for any reason or purpose.  You may be asked to sign a Contributor 
License Agreement before we can merge your Pull Requests.  If this is 
unacceptable, please do not open a Pull Request.

We cannot currently pay for content submitted in Pull Requests.  However, as we 
intend for the content to be in a continuous state of refresh and renewal, we
want to acknowledge all contributions that have built the site up to its current
great state.  Therefore, it is our intent that every page or section of the
site should have a collapseable panel or tray with acknowledgements where
contributors can place their screen name and a short message for posterity as
part of their Pull Requests.

Please note we have a code of conduct.  Please follow it in all your
interactions with the project.

### Pull Request Process

1. Wherever possible, please invite others from the ClubCompy community to
   contribute edits and feedback to your Pull Request.  The more eyes we have
   on your contribution, and the more robust conversation we have, the better
   the final product will be. 
1. Please indicate in a Pull Request comment that copyrights to all materials
   added or changed by Contributor(s) are assigned to Woldrich, Inc.  (e.g.
   "I hereby assign copyrights to all materials in this Pull Request to 
   Woldrich, Inc. in perpetuity.")  
1. Project owners will be responsible for merging the Pull Request if it is a
   good fit for the site and all outstanding TODO's have been completed. 

### Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and owners pledge to making participation in our project and

include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community

#### Our Responsibilities

Project owners are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project owners have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

#### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project owners.

#### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported privately by contacting the project team at the [feedback page at
ClubCompy.com](https://clubcompy.com/feedback). 

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a
response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The
project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may
be posted separately.
